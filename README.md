Synopsis

- After finishing the first class, I felt a bit overwhelmed since it was my first time trying a course that taught a coding language.
- The first step was brainstorming to see what I could create.
- I wanted to create a simplified representation of a sunset and sunrise, something metaphorical.
- I decided to experiment with basic geometric shapes: a circle and a triangle.
- I imagined the circle moving down to mimic the setting sun, and then reversing to represent the sunrise.
- From my previous experience in design, I was familiar with the basics of RGB color. I chose some main colors for the shapes: red and yellow.

Summary/Problem solving

- I visited https://p5js.org/reference/p5/circle/ and researched a bit about the circle, exploring some basic functions and the possibilities I could do with this shape.

- At the beginning, creating the shapes was easy and not very difficult. However, frustration started to appear when I realized my lack of knowledge about making the animation work was a significant issue.
  
- I visited www.google.com to ask if p5.js has any references for transformations. The information I found was a bit complex for me, but it was very useful in understanding my limits.

- A problem I encountered was making the circle drop down in the canvas at the desired speed. In the end, I had to use trial and error to succeed.

- I visited back https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967 and  I gained some basic knowledge from the lecture videos. 
I ended up animating a circle moving downwards and representing a mountain with a triangle.

- In the end, I got closer to the animation I wanted; however, there is a lot to improve regarding speed, movement, transformations, and elements bouncing back.

  
Future development

- To solve the problem I encountered, I want to learn how to create transformations and understand how to use p5.js to execute actions with compressed code. My goal is to use these new skills to create art.

Conclusion

- I have concluded that my mind constantly seeks to push beyond its limits. Coding can be very distracting, but if you dedicate time to it, you can bring your ideas to life.
