I take my classmate's workshop 0 project and develop it response to the workshop 4 task.
<br>
<Br>
This work is forked from Andres Lara Suaza's workshop-task-0.<br>

## task
[] Create an interactive p5.js sketch with at least three different kinds of user input events.<Br>
[] Experiment with ways to record and redeploy inputs from the user.<Br>

I followed the workshop and tried using the emojis I set. However, the problem that keeps appearing was that when I went live, I kept having problems that only loading appeared.<Br>
